# Quantifying the stochastic component of epigenetic aging  
**Category**: reproduction of the paper

### Short introduction  
Epigenetic clocks are multivariate linear models that can predict chronological and biological age, based on DNA methylation (DNAm) data. 
Age-associated DNAm changes are observed in two phenomena – first, the evidence of specific age-associated DNAm changes, and second, the evidence of `erosion` or increasing uniformity of DNAm landscape, associated with age. 
Thus, two phenomena can be considered deterministic and stochastic components of quasi-stochastic epigenetic changes associated with age. 
In this regard, understanding the contribution of stochastic component to the accuracy of linear models (clocks) prediction represents a fundamental interest. 
### Main hypothesis:  
according to the paper, approximately 66–75% of the accuracy underpinning Horvath’s clock could be driven by a stochastic process.
### Goals:
1. Reproduce the stochastic simulation for Horvath’s clock;  
2. Construct a stochastic analog (StocH clock) using DNAm dataset;  
3. Quantify the stochastic component of Horvath’s clock in one of the sorted immune cell datasets.
