	abstract = {DNA methylation clocks can accurately estimate chronological age and, to some extent, also biological age, yet the process by which age-associated DNA methylation (DNAm) changes are acquired appears to be quasi-stochastic, raising a fundamental question: how much of an epigenetic clock’s predictive accuracy could be explained by a stochastic process of DNAm change? Here, using DNAm data from sorted immune cells, we build realistic simulation models, subsequently demonstrating in over 22,770 sorted and whole-blood samples from 25 independent cohorts that approximately 66–75\% of the accuracy underpinning Horvath’s clock could be driven by a stochastic process. This fraction increases to 90\% for the more accurate Zhang’s clock, but is lower (63\%) for the PhenoAge clock, suggesting that biological aging is reflected by nonstochastic processes. Confirming this, we demonstrate that Horvath’s age acceleration in males and PhenoAge’s age acceleration in severe coronavirus disease 2019 cases and smokers are not driven by an increased rate of stochastic change but by nonstochastic processes. These results significantly deepen our understanding and interpretation of epigenetic clocks.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is not yet known whether DNA methylation levels can be used to accurately predict age across a broad spectrum of human tissues and cell types, nor whether the resulting age prediction is a biologically meaningful measure.
RESULTS: I developed a multi-tissue predictor of age that allows one to estimate the DNA methylation age of most tissues and cell types. The predictor, which is freely available, was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. I found that DNA methylation age has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; second, it correlates with cell passage number; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues. Analysis of 6,000 cancer samples from 32 datasets showed that all of the considered 20 cancer types exhibit significant age acceleration, with an average of 36 years. Low age-acceleration of cancer tissue is associated with a high number of somatic mutations and TP53 mutations, while mutations in steroid receptors greatly accelerate DNA methylation age in breast cancer. Finally, I characterize the 353 CpG sites that together form an aging clock in terms of chromatin states and tissue variance.
CONCLUSIONS: I propose that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system. This novel epigenetic clock can be used to address a host of questions in developmental biology, cancer and aging research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA methylation changes that accrue in the stem cell pool of an adult tissue in line with the cumulative number of cell divisions may contribute to the observed variation in cancer risk among tissues and individuals. Thus, the construction of epigenetic "mitotic" clocks that can measure the lifetime number of stem cell divisions is of paramount interest.
METHODS: Building upon a dynamic model of DNA methylation gain in unmethylated CpG-rich regions, we here derive a novel mitotic clock ("epiTOC2") that can directly estimate the cumulative number of stem cell divisions in a tissue. We compare epiTOC2 to a different mitotic model, based on hypomethylation at solo-WCGW sites ("HypoClock"), in terms of their ability to measure mitotic age of normal adult tissues and predict cancer risk.
RESULTS: Using epiTOC2, we estimate the intrinsic stem cell division rate for different normal tissue types, demonstrating excellent agreement (Pearson correlation = 0.92, R2 = 0.85, P = 3e-6) with those derived from experiment. In contrast, HypoClock's estimates do not (Pearson correlation = 0.30, R2 = 0.09, P = 0.29). We validate these results in independent datasets profiling normal adult tissue types. While both epiTOC2 and HypoClock correctly predict an increased mitotic rate in cancer, epiTOC2 is more robust and significantly better at discriminating preneoplastic lesions characterized by chronic inflammation, a major driver of tissue turnover and cancer risk. Our data suggest that DNA methylation loss at solo-WCGWs is significant only when cells are under high replicative stress and that epiTOC2 is a better mitotic age and cancer risk prediction model for normal adult tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: These results have profound implications for our understanding of epigenetic clocks and for developing cancer risk prediction or early detection assays. We propose that measurement of DNAm at the 163 epiTOC2 CpGs in adult pre-neoplastic lesions, and potentially in serum cell-free DNA, could provide the basis for building feasible pre-diagnostic or cancer risk assays. epiTOC2 is freely available from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2632938.},

	abstract = {Age-related variations in DNA methylation have been reported; however, the functional relevance of these differentially methylated sites (age-dMS) are unclear. Here we report potentially functional age-dMS, defined as age- and cis-gene expression-associated methylation sites (age-eMS), identified by integrating genome-wide CpG methylation and gene expression profiles collected ex vivo from circulating T cells (227 CD4+ samples) and monocytes (1,264 CD14+ samples, age range: 55–94 years). None of the age-eMS detected in 227 T-cell samples are detectable in 1,264 monocyte samples, in contrast to the majority of age-dMS detected in T cells that replicated in monocytes. Age-eMS tend to be hypomethylated with older age, located in predicted enhancers and preferentially linked to expression of antigen processing and presentation genes. These results identify and characterize potentially functional age-related methylation in human T cells and monocytes, and provide novel insights into the role age-dMS may have in the aging process.},
